# Code-Refactor
Homework #1 4/29

I did this project for UofA becuase I want to learn how to code, and I love coding.

I updated this website for the visually impared, and to add int alt text to allow for SEO terms for Google, even though there is no point to add alt text to images if there is no meta description on the page due to the way google weights different things, also H2 should never be listed multiple places espcially in the footer, but from a code prespective this is a great task.
